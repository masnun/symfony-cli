# Symfony2 CLI

A global command line tool inspired by <a href="https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/artisan-cli">Artisan CLI</a>

## What does it do?

It finds the `app/console` file and runs it for you so that you can run commands like: 

	symfony <command> 
	
Instead of:

	php app/console <command>
	

## Installation

Install using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```shell
composer global require masnun/symfony-cli:*
```

## Bugs/Issues? 

There shouldn't be many. Please email: masnun@transcendio.net if you find any :)
